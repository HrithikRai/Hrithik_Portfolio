Hey there...Glad you landed here...These are some of my Data Science Projects.

# Project 1 - Regression Analysis - Bike Sharing Demand Estimation
## Kaggle competition - [Bike Sharing Demand](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand)

* This Bike sharing system will function as a sensor network, which can be used for studying mobility in a city. Here we combine historical usage patterns with weather data in order to forecast bike rental demand in the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C.
* Used a multilinear regression model. You can find the project [here](https://github.com/HrithikRai/Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction)
* Bike sharing demand prediction using hourly dataset (17379 rows, 17 features)
* Took care of Multiple Linear Regression Assumptions :
  1. Autocorrelation
  2. Multicollinearity
  3. Endogeneity
  4. Residual Normality
* Libraries used - Pandas,Numpy,Matplotlib,Math,sklearn
* RMSLE score of the predictor = 0.3560. **This falls under the top 1 percentile(<0.367) of the Kaggle Bike Prediction Comp.**
